It can only be used in the domain it is written.

EXAMPLES

Single Query
SELECT x FROM y
SELECT x FROM y, ORDER BY z.

Filtering
SELECT x FROM y WHERE z = "foobar";
SELECT x FROM y WHERE z = "foo" AND q != "bar";
SELECT x FROM y WHERE z = "foo" OR q = "bar";
SELECT x FROM y WHERE z LIKE "_oobar";
SELECT x FROM y WHERE z BETWEEN 1 AND 100;
SELECT x FROM y WHERE z IS NOT NULL;
SELECT x FROM y WHERE z IN ("foo", "bar", "foobar");

Multiple Query
SELECT x FROM y JOIN z
SELECT x FROM y LEFT JOIN z
SELECT x FROM y FULL JOIN z
SELECT x FROM y CROSS JOIN z
SELECT x FROM y NATURAL JOIN z
SELECT x FROM y INNER JOIN z ON q;

Grouping
SELECT x FROM y GROUP BY z;

Aggregates
SELECT COUNT(x) FROM y;
SELECT MIN(x) FROM y;
SELECT MAX(x) FROM y;
SELECT SUM(x) FROM y;
SELECT AVg(x) FROM y;

Aliases
SELECT x AS q FROM y;
