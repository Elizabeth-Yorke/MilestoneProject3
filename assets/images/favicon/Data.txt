DATA STORE
Acts as a repository to hold an organization's data.
After filling it with data a data store becomes an archive that can then be searched.
It equips decision makers with the power to identify trends and patterns that are important to business.

THE DBMS
Database Management Service
- Stores data
- Updates stored data
- Retrieves stored data

A SERVER
A program that runs continually, processing requests from people and applications that want to use its services.

RELATIONAL
- Most common (linked databases)
- SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to send commands
- Well defined structure (tables with named columns). Schema.
- PK (primary keys) are unique IDs that define each record or row, and do not change if data entries change.
- FK (primary key from another table - so you can use data from one table in another table)
- This means changes to data only has to happen on one table for all the tables to access it.

NON-RELATIONAL
- No SQL links between databases
- No fixed schema or structure
- JSON, XML, BSON
- All documents are separate
- Can use different fields on the same table
- key value data, graph stores, time-series data, geo-spatial databases, wide-column databases

MODELLING DATA
- Changing the data model as you go along is quite tricky with relational datatbases.
3 DESIGN PHASES:
- Conceptual (mapping out main entities, relationships and attributes)
- Logical (decide actual database schema, and associate tables with columns)
- Physical (deciding how each table should be stored in a computer)

Model structures are also known as ERDs.
